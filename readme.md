# Welcome aboard!

## Preparations
Here're some online references you may turn to when you have trouble with git, python etc.<br>
* [git tutorial](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/0013739516305929606dd18361248578c67b8067c8c017b000)<br>
* [python 3 tutorial](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/0014316089557264a6b348958f449949df42a6d3a2e542c000)

## Get started

0. Clone the repo
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/ShaneTsui/Leetcode.git
# You can also ask the owner to add your public key to this repo, then you could use ssh
git clone git@github.com:ShaneTsui/Leetcode.git
```

1. Set up and switch to your own branch
```shell
git checkout -b YOU-BRANCH-NAME
```

2. Set up your own folder, which will be your personal little coding universe~
```shell
mkdir YOU-FOLDER-NAME
```
**Suggestion**:You could organize the sub-folders' structure as you wish, which could base on difficulties, tags(e.g array, string...), or what so ever as you wish~

3. Enjoy coding~

4. Use "git add" to track your latest changes, and "git commit" them to your local repository.
```shell
git add FILES-TO-BE-TRACKED
git commit -m 'YOUR-COMMENTS'
# You can also track all files and commit them to the local repo
git commit -a -m 'YOUR-COMMENTS'
```

5. Merge your brach to the master branch, and use github as a memo of your progress.
```shell
git checkout master
git merge YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
```

6. [Optional] You may upload all your code to github regularly.
```shell
git pull
# If conflits appear, solve it first.
git push
```
